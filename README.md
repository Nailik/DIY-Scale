# DIY-Scale
Very thin DIY scale with bluetooth and wifi - intended to be used with a coffee machine.

More information can be found on my [Website](https://kilian-eller.de/en/projects/diy-scale)

There are currently some issues that should be resolved.
<ul>
 <li> Sometimes the scale freezes when connected to usb power
 <li> Weight drifts while plugged in
</ul>

More information about this is in the "Projects" Tab.
